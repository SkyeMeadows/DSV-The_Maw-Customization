# DSV S3 Modifiers
This will likely be a messy mod, as it will be a conjucntion of modadjuster, and other custom aspects.

Karynyxium - An Orange exotic catalyst that can only be found within the outermost areas of the black hole's gravity well. (0.05-0.10g)
- Used to make high-tech components and blocks
- Very low yield per voxel mined
- Raw Ore is used for fuel for Karynxium Reactors, which are only less powerful than (buffed) prototech reactors
- Ingots are made in a special refinery, and then used in various Components
- Many components may grind to scrap
- Components must be made in a special assembler

Cyrite -  A Blue-ish rare metal that can be found anywhere in space, but in trace amounts. 
- Used to make heavier duty blocks
- Low yield per voxel mined
- Ingots are made in a special refinery, and then used in a small group of common components.
- Items take a long time to craft due to working with a very hard metal

Void-Scarred Metal - A deep black material created by combining Karnyxium with vast amounts of Cyrite
- Used to distort space-time and prevent jump drives nearby from functioning
- Unknown future uses




Component List:
Vanilla Ingots:
- Heating Coil - Crafted from platinum, nickel, silicon, gold - Used in Industrial Crucible (used to make cyrite)
- Hardened Mechanisms - Crafted from Platinum, cobalt, silicon, gold, silver - Used in Advanced Assembler (Used to make Cyrite & karnyxium parts)


Basic:
- Echo Seal - Crafted from slight amounts of Cyrite, cobalt - Used in ALL (Karnyxium tier) functional blocks - Lore: To keep the Karnyxium at bay, a similar void-like material needs to hold Karnyxium in place
- Hardened Plate - Crafted from Cyrite, iron, cobalt - Used in custom armor


Advanced:
- Gravity Conduit - Crafted from Karnyxium, gold, platinum, iron - Used in Karnyxium Reactors
- Electrified Crystal - Crafted from Karnyxium, gold, nickel - Used in (karnyxium tier) Batteries.
- Catalyst Capacitor - Crafted from Karnyxium, Cyrite, magnesium - Used in Karnyxium Reactors & batteries
- Entropy Matrix - Crafted from Karnyxium, Cyrite, cobalt, iron - Used in (karnyxium tier) Gyroscopes
- Jump Catalyst - Crafted from Karnyxium, gold, platinum - Used in (karnyxium tier) Jump Drives


Exotic:
- Space-Time Disruptor Component - Crafted from Void-Scarred Metal, gold, platinum, silicon (all in large quantities) - used in Jump Drive Disruptor/Inhibitor


Prototech + Void-Scarred Metal ("Singularity Items"):
- Singularity Core - Used in all blocks, replaces the prototech frame




Component Ideas (Courtesy of Zidane):
Set One: Core Zealot Components
Broad usage across all modded blocks

Component Name    Description
Gravitic Inverter    Used in nearly all TCOTM blocks. A component believed to "balance the forces of descent and ascent" within the Maw’s pull.
Void Alloy    A dense, dark metallic compound supposedly "sung into being" near the event horizon. Common reinforcement material.
Singularity Conduit    An energy pathway made from black-hole-hardened materials. Used for internal power and signal routing.



Set Two: Cult-Specific Enhancements
Used in sets of blocks. Some shared use, some specialized.

Component Name    Usage Focus    Description
Mawsight Sensor    Detectors, Jump Drives    Crafted to “see through spacetime,” tuned to black hole radiation
Oblivion Capacitor    Power, Production    Stores energy in the “echo between ticks,” unstable but potent
Flesh of the Rift    Cargo, Tanks    A reactive, semi-organic composite said to be grown from rift matter
Hallowed Lattice    Structural Blocks    Nanostructured framework used in all non-thrust internal systems
Void-Scarred Coil    Thrusters, Tools    High-energy coil that exhibits quantum instability—worshipped for its 'chaotic hum'
Event Horizon Lens    Jump Drives, Detectors    Used to focus navigational data warped by gravity wells
Entropy Matrix    Gyroscopes, Tools    Matrix that “resonates with rotational decay,” supposedly improving precision
Echoing Seal    Used broadly    Functions like a control chip; lore describes it as capturing the Maw’s “voice”
