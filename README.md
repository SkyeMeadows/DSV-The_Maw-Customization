# DSV S3 Modifiers
This will likely be a messy mod, as it will be a conjucntion of modadjuster, and other custom aspects.

# Game Modifications
Production blocks will have their power consumption increased by a factor of 3x

# Custom Resources
## Karynyxium
An Orange exotic catalyst that can only be found within the outermost areas of the black hole's gravity well. (0.05-0.10g)
- Used to make high-tech components and blocks
- Very low yield per voxel mined
- Raw Ore is used for fuel for Karynxium Reactors, which are only less powerful than (buffed) prototech reactors
- Ingots are made in a special refinery, and then used in various Components
- Many components may grind to scrap
- Components must be made in a special assembler

## Cyrite
A Blue-ish rare metal that can be found anywhere in space, but in trace amounts. 
- Used to make heavier duty blocks
- Low yield per voxel mined
- Ingots are made in a special refinery, and then used in a small group of common components.
- Items take a long time to craft due to working with a very hard metal
